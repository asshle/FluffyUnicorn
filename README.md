# SCDF X IBM Lifesavers Hackathon 

## Project Description 

The following solutions consists of prototype implementation of the Residential Smart Fire Alarm , the project 
consist of various different component ranging from feild IOT sensors to cloud technology. 

The idea for this project comes from analysing major causes of fire in singapore. In 2019 out of 2,826 fire calls , 
40.8% of them came from residential premises. So the idea for this technology is how can we detect fire in residential 
area in its early stages where anyone could put out the fire , or when the fire is in it's later stage ,help evacuate 
anyone in the proximity.With this implementation we feel like this might be able to cut down on SCDF manpower as well as 
provide faster detection of residential fire.  

The hardware for this project includes an IOT device that act as an feild controller for feild senses to sense make the 
data generated by the sensors. The IOT device will also act as an communication module between the cloud network and the 
sensors. Besides that , we wanted to add these IOT devices into a network of other IOT device where in an event of an fire 
these devices will communicate amongst themselves to  inform where the fire is located. The mesh network can be used to inform 
residents near the fire to evacuate to a safer location and at the same time , if the fire gets bigger , will notify SCDF for 
intervention. 

The cloud portion includes Node Red where it acts as an command center for SCDF to monitor all the statuses of these devices,
such as the Fire sensor reading , battery life , locations of such devices. We will utilise IBM push notifications for alerting 
of the user in the events of a fire.

## Getting started
Hardware setup :
```
For prototyping we used an ESP32 dev kit c wroom.
The software was written in arduino C++ 
to allow the code to be able to run on your computer , you will need to have arduino IDE installed on your computer. [Arduino IDE Download](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)

On first install , you will require to add a board library as well as some service library to make the source code usuable on your computer

    To add the board:
    -On the top left hand panel click on **File > Preferences**
    -Under Additional Board Manager URLs add this url link *https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json*
    -Once done , go to the top left hand corner and select **Tools> Board > Board Managers **  
    -In there , search for "**ESP32**" select the one by esprieff systems
    -After adding the board libraries , select "**Esp32 Dev Module**"

    After that you are ready to use the ESP32 on your IDE for more detailed description click [here](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/)

For this project we used 1 other external library 

    To add new library in arduino IDE: 
    -On the top left hand corner select **Tools > Manage Libraries**
    -An window should appear search for "**ArduinoJson**"
    -Select the library from "Benoit Blanchon"
    -Ensure that the version for the ArduinoJson is 5.0.0 if not the code will not work

After following the above instruction , you should be able to run the program without an issue
